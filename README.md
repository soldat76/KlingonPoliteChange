# KlingonPoliteChange
A school assignment where we had to create a program to properly hand out change after a purchase.

__Klingon Monetary System (Background)__

As we can well imagine, Klingon monetary system is a little different from the monetary systems used on earth.

In the Klingon world, the money (coins) are:
* the lru, worth 90 monetary units (mu),
* the talon, worth 30 monetary units (mu),
* the darsek, worth 10 monetary units (mu), and
* the shhhrok, worth 1 monetary unit (mu).

By the way, the name of the Klingon money does not have a plural form, i.e., no s is ever added to them. For example: 2 darsek (as opposed to 2 darseks).

The way Klingon shop owners give change back to Klingon customers when they purchase items is also particular. As we may already know, it is quite rude to give change back incorrectly in the Klingon world.

Here is an example of what we mean by giving change back incorrectly, i.e., giving rude change, as it is called. Suppose we are purchasing a plate of gawk or some tlhIngan Soj at 5310 mu and we pay 5383 mu for the purchase, we will receive 73 mu back. Nothing rude so far.

Now, if the Klingon shop owner gives us:
* 1 talon, 4 darsek and 3 shhhrok, or
* 7 darsek and 3 shhhrok, or
* 73 shhhrok
then we should be very insulted, as any of the above combinations of change would be considered rude, i.e. rude change

The polite change, on the other hand, would be 2 talon, 1 darsek and 3 shhhrok.

In order to give polite change to a Klingon customer, the Klingon shop owner must first give the maximum amount of lru and from what remains of the change, s/he must then give the maximum amount of talon, and from what remains of the change, s/he must then give the maximum amount of darsek, and then s/he gives what remains of the change in shhhrok.
